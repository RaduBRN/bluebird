# Bluebird

This is a JavaScript app that displays a tweet feed, inspired by the popular social media platform Twitter. Users can like, retweet, and reply to tweets. The app is built using vanilla JavaScript and uses hardcoded data from a data file.

## Usage

Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the tweet feed.

Users can interact with the tweets by clicking on the like, retweet, or reply buttons. Clicking on the tweet button will add a new tweet to the top of the feed.

## Dependencies

The app uses the uuid library from https://jspm.dev/uuid to generate unique identifiers for new tweets.
